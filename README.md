# Exposure Classification with CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images based on their exposure into four categories:

-  **Overexposed**
-  **Underexposed**
-  **Poor Contrast**
-  **Normal**

It was developed using TensorFlow/Keras in Google Colab with a custom dataset.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The CNN model includes:

- Multiple Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
- Dropout and L2 Regularization to reduce overfitting
- Softmax output for multi-class classification
- Early stopping based on validation loss

## How to Run

You can run this project entirely in Google Colab. Follow the steps below:
- Upload the datset to google drive
- Mount the drive
- Insatll requirements
        -tensorflow>=2.8.0 ()
        -numpy
        -matplotlib
        -(pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib)
- Download the file exposure_classifier_model.h5 which contains the trained model
- Load the model from drive and using model.predict Predict the output.
( Demo- image_classifier_modelcheck.ipynb for a complete walkthrough of prediction.)
