Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m1/1\u001b[0m \u001b[32m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[37m\u001b[0m \u001b[1m0s\u001b[0m 103ms/step\n","Predicted Class: normal\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lCxU6IK_2RNn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
